A simple client server application using Lua and Protobuf.

Run server on the M4223 device.

Run client from a terminal window after editing the M4223 IP address.

The messages.proto file must be available to both the client and server.

The pb.lua file and pb directory are the Lua Protobuf support files which
will be needed for the client to run.  These are already insalled on the
M4223.  In addition you might need to install the struct and lpeg Lua packages.


The client prompts for a series of basic arithmetic operations.  You can
specify a+b or a*b, where a and b are real numbers.  In addition you
can specify both addition and multiplication on the same line by comma
separating the two operations.  Spaces are also permitted.

To exit, enter "quit" on a line by itself.
